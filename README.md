A repository for the fullstack application Let's do Korean. The site aims to make it easier for individuals to learn the basics and improving their understanding of the korean language, while having a fun time doing so.

## Installation

    Clone repo
    run npm install
    update DATABASE_URL in config/database

## Usage

    run node server.js or npm start
    Update PORT variable (for example 8000)
    Navigate to localhost:8000


## Optimizations

Structured using the MVC architecture. Which seperates all the components into better and more maintainable components. Through using MVC it will make any changes easier to implement while simplifying troubleshooting and bug fixing (should there be a need for this).

The backend is built up of clear naming schemes in order to be able to add on potential features while and making this process as simple as possible.

## Lessons Learned:

# Progression
Dealing with a project where progression is a large part of the objective. Implementing something like this required some "clever" thinking to implement it in a way which would be easy to understand while still being efficient.

# Fullstack
Because this project is a fullstack application all of the components needed to be connected in the right way. So there were a certain amount of issues in how the backend would interact with the frontend. Which required going through the documentation and problem-solving for certain specific issues 

# Deploying
During the development of this project Heroku decided to discontinue their free hosting tier. This required me to go through some of the options which offered a good value. I settled on Railway for their good standing in the community and reasonable hosting fee. There were some issues with the way files were initally named, so some adjustments were required according to the documentation that Railway has.

## Additional features

The core of the app is up and functioning. There are however some features I wish to implement later on
<ul>
  <li>Improve styling</li>
  <li>Add more sections to study</li>
  <li>Add a leadership board (using the points)</li>
  <li>Improve test to make it easier to do</li>
  <li>Add functionality for adding friends?</li>
  <li>Create your own study sections (shareable?), How to moderate if allowing user input?</li>
  <li>Add profile images?</li>
</ul>
